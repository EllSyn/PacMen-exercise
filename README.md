# PacMen-exercise

## Description

In this exercise the objective was to create a type of game where the user can click a button to create PacMen and then hit another button to make them move around in different directions. I have also added a button to make the PacMen open and close their mouths.

## How to run

You have to clone the project to your own computer. Then you simply open the index.html file in a browser window. To create a PacMan hit the "Add PacMan" button. To make the PacMen move hit the "Start Game" button, and to make them bite/eat hit the "Bite button" in the top left corner.

## Roadmap pf future improvements

In the future the game will hopefully be able to handle more user interactions, like moving a PacMan with the mouse. I would also like to add some styling to the game and put a nice frame around the game window
